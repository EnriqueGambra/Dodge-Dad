# Dodge-Dad
A little game I made just to dodge my father's head. Made in pygame.

- Allows you to control a character (my mom)
- Point of the game is to dodge my Father's giant head
- Able to jump and move from right to left. Use the arrow keys to move right and left, spacebar to jump
- After a period of time, level will increase
- As level increases, speed of the game increases. Character speed increases, heads falling increases.
- You have 4 lives. Lives left are displayed on the top left of the screen
- Current level is on the top right of the screen
- High score is displayed at the top middle of the screen
- If your score is higher than the score included in the text file, it will be updated
